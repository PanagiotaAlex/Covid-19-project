# Covid-19-project
A repository to upload the work for my internship

In this internship i will work on data analysis problems in the field of medical cases related with the Covid-19 Pandemia. I will consider models to explain the available data and relationships among variables, such as populations from different countries, number of hospitals, or others.

The project will cover the following steps:
1. Select the data sets
2. Pre-processing: detect outliers, remove noise, detect missing values 
3.Transformation: normalize data, find correlated variables
4.Data mining: e.g. Classification, clustering, regression, etc. 
5.Interpretation/evaluation
